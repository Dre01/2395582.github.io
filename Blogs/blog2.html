      <p>What are URLs and how do they work?</p>
      <p>
        The acronym URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is essentially,
        the address of a given unique resource on the Web. Theoretically, every
        valid URL would lead to a specific resource on the Web, unless the
        resource has been moved or otherwise tampered with. A URL could lead you
        anywhere, to an image or a video, audio files, a HTML page or a CSS
        document.
      </p>
      <p>
        A URL is most commonly made up of three distinct parts, namely: the
        scheme, the authority, and the path.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scheme is the first part of the URL, and it indicates the protocol
        the browser must use to request the resource. This protocol will
        commonly look like; HTTPS, itâ€™s riskier cousin HTTP or even mail-to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second part, the authority houses the domain and sometimes the port,
        in specific instances. The domain is an indicator of which Web server is
        being requested. Usually this is shown in the form of a domain name, but
        an IP address may also me used at the risk of making things
        inconvenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        The port indicates the technical gate used to access the resources. If
        the standard ports of HTTP or HTTPS are used (80 for HTTP and 443 for
        HTTPS) then the port is usually omitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third part is the path. Quite self-explanatory, this part refers to
        the path to the resource that you are trying to access.
