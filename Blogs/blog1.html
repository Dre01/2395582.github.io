      <p>‘As We May Think’ at 65</p>
      <p>
        “Come writers and critics Who prophesize with your pen.” - Bob Dylan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prophetic nature of ‘As We May Think’ is hard to miss. It’s
        certainly not lost on Harper who does admit that the piece has reached
        "pensionable age" but goes on to rhetorically ask; "... why does this
        work still continue to resonate 65 years after it was first published?"
        To think of an article published in the 40s being a precursor to the
        World Wide Web (Ohhhh so that’s what WWW stands for), seems a bit
        strange at first, but the predictive element in the piece cannot be
        denied. Hence the Bob Dylan quote.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harper’s dissection of the then 65-year-old piece, focuses mainly on
        Bush’s thoughts on information gathering through association, rather
        than through an abstract, hierarchical structure. This is because of the
        insistence that the human brain, works through association; one thought
        leads to the next, then to the next and so on. The logical step, then is
        that if information is to be provided to the human brain it should be in
        a way that follows this method of associative learning. This would
        result in better retention and understanding of information, which is
        ultimately the goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        However this notion, while very romantic is not exactly viable. As a
        result we have been forced to revert back to hierarchical structures.
        This is because of the vast amounts of information and the vast amounts
        of people perusing it. It becomes quite difficult to cater to the
        individual when there are so many individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result we have a system which has ridiculously vast amounts of
        information to dispel in a way that is not entirely conducive to an
        exercise in genuine information gathering. If the information can not be
        learned in a way that is better to understand, than understanding, most
        likely, will not come.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I’ve decided to take from this reading, or rather couldn’t help but
        take form this reading is that the way we provide the information is
        almost as important as the information itself. Which is why a definite
        effort is required in innovating in this field and attempting to fulfill
        what Bush regarded our mission – “… it is the privilege of man to learn
        to understand, and that this is his mission.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to end with a quote from the piece: “Personal associations
        derived from experience … enable us to learn better and understand
        better.”
