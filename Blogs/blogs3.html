      <p>The What, Why and How of Metadata.</p>
      <p>
        The prefix ‘meta’ refers to an underlying definition or description.
        ‘Data’ refers to information of any kind. Metadata therefore refers to
        the data surrounding or describing another set of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the data is a document, then the metadata refers to the attributes of
        that data which make it easier to find. It is essentially a system of
        tags which hold the attributes of the data and make the process of
        searching for it easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantages this can lend to webpages are obvious. The ‘tags’ or
        metatags are embedded in the document making it easier for search
        engines to find the data. By including metatags in your webpage, the
        chances of somebody finding that page increase tremendously. The best
        metatags essentially act as VIP access to the highly esteemed club that
        is the first page of Google. (or Bing if you’re into that.)
      </p>
      <p>
        These metatags would contain information that makes it easier for the
        page to be found. Information such as the description of the webpage and
        keywords linked to the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Metadata can be created manually or through an automated process.
        Manually obviously has the advantage of being able to directly dictate
        what sort of information is held in the metatags, while automatic
        usually has just the basics.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several different types of metadata each serving a unique
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Administrative metadata allows for the implementation of administrative
        systems to the data, such as granting or restricting access and
        permissions etc.
      </p>
      <p>Legal metadata affords information on creative licenses.</p>
      <p>
        Descriptive identifies unique attributes of the data, such as keywords,
        bibliographies etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many more types of metadata each with its own use but all in
        essence doing the same thing; Linking, describing, and giving context to
        a main set of data and thus making it easier to find, peruse and
        ultimately use.
