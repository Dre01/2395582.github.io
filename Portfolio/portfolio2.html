      <p class="title">The Prison Visit</p>
      <p>
        Sofia walks into the room and sits at the assigned seat, tucking her
        skirt under her legs. Her husband, Vinny is already waiting for her on
        the other side of the glass. He smiles broadly, speaking words she can’t
        hear. He picks up the phone on his side of the partition and motions for
        her to do the same. She wraps a handkerchief around the handle and
        brings the phone to her ear.
      </p>
      <p>
        They talk, his smile always a bit broader than hers. He leans back in
        his chair and asks her something. She answers with a small nod, the
        corners of her mouth twitching. Tears well up in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vinny leans forward to console his wife. He says something, making her
        smile. She looks at him, tilting her head at a slight angle. Her free
        hand moves forward, meets the partition, then returns to her lap.
      </p>
      <p>
        He asks a question. She composes herself and answers in a way akin to a
        waitress reciting back a large order. He nods then leans back again. He
        asks something else. Her free hand grabs a handful of skirt under the
        table. It appears as though the waitress has forgotten the sugar. He
        yells, then looks around over his shoulder. He leans in closer and
        lowers his voice. He speaks slowly. She nods frantically, prompting a
        tear to roll down her cheek. He sighs, then soothes her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She smiles. He leans back and lights a cigarette. A guard cuts off his
        next sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        He blows smoke in the guard’s face and sends him walking. The guard is
        quickly replaced by the warden. He grabs Vinny’s arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vinny stands up and shrugs the warden off. He turns back to his wife and
        says something. For the first time in their exchange his smile falters a
        bit. Sofia notices and stands up. She nods in response, tears now
        flowing freely down her face. Her final words are cut off as the warden
        slams the phone into the receiver. Her husband gives her a final wink
        and a smile, then he’s gone.
